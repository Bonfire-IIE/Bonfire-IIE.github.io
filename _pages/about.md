Leaded by [Prof.Xiaojun Chen](https://xiaoj-chen.github.io), we are undering **Data Security Laboratory** of the Institute of Information Engineering (IIE), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).

Established with a passion for scientific exploration and innovation, our laboratory is a hub of cutting-edge research and discovery. Our laboratory is primarily engaged in researching **Artificial Intelligence Security**, covering areas such as *Privacy Computing, Federated Learning, Backdoor Attacks, Model Watermarking, and AI Security*. In the realm of privacy computing, we strive to safeguard data privacy while enabling efficient computational processes. Federated learning offers a collaborative approach to model training without sacrificing data privacy. Backdoor attacks pose a serious threat, and we are constantly on the lookout for effective countermeasures. Model watermarking helps protect intellectual property and ensure the integrity of models. Additionally, we are actively investigating the security of large models to meet the emerging challenges in this rapidly evolving field.

Our team consists of four teachers, thirteen doctoral candidates, two master candidates and one visiting student. With a diverse group of talented individuals, our laboratory is a vibrant hub of research and innovation. We look forward to sharing our findings and collaborating with others in the pursuit of a more secure artificial intelligence future.
